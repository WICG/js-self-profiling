      This specification describes an API that allows web applications to control a sampling profiler for measuring client JavaScript execution times.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      Complex web applications currently have limited visibility into where JS
      execution time is spent on clients. Without the ability to efficiently
      collect stack samples, applications are forced to instrument their code
      with profiling hooks that are imprecise and can significantly slow down
      execution. By providing an API to manipulate a sampling profiler,
      applications can gather rich execution data for aggregation and analysis
      with minimal overhead.
      </p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <pre class="example">
        const profiler = await performance.profile({ sampleInterval: 10 });
        for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {
             doWork();
        }
        const trace = await profiler.stop();
        sendTrace(trace);

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      A <dfn data-lt="sample|samples">sample</dfn> is a descriptor of the
      instantaneous state of execution at a given point in time. Each sample is
      associated with a <a>stack</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      A <dfn>stack</dfn> is a list of <a>frames</a> that MUST be ordered
      sequentially from outermost to innermost frame.
      </p>
      <p>
      A <dfn data-lt="frame|frames">frame</dfn> is an element in the context of a <a>stack</a>
      containing information about the current execution state.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Profiling Sessions</h2>
      <p>
      A <dfn>profiling session</dfn> is an abstract producer of <a>samples</a>. Each session has:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A <dfn data-cite="!HTML#global-object">global object</dfn> as defined in [[HTML]].</li>
        <li>A <dfn>state</dfn>, which is one of <code>{started, paused, stopped}</code>.</li>
        <li>
          A <dfn>sample interval</dfn>, defined as the periodicity at which the session obtains samples.
          <p class="note">
          The UA is NOT REQUIRED to take samples at this rate. However, it is
          RECOMMENDED that sampling is prioritized to take samples at this rate to
          produce higher quality traces.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>An <dfn data-cite="!HTML#origin">origin</dfn>.</li>
        <li>A <dfn data-cite="!HR-TIME-2#dfn-time-origin">time origin</dfn> that samples' timestamps are measured relative to.</li>
        <li>A <dfn>sample buffer</dfn> storing captured <a>samples</a>, with a finite <dfn>sample buffer size limit</dfn>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      Multiple profiling sessions on the same page SHOULD be supported.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>States</h2>
        <p>
        In the <code>started</code> state, the UA SHOULD make a best-effort to
        capture samples by executing the appropriate <a>sampling algorithm</a>
        each time the <a>sample interval</a> has elapsed.
        In the <code>paused</code> and <code>stopped</code> states, the UA SHOULD NOT capture samples.
        </p>
        <p>
        Profiling sessions MUST begin in the <code>started</code> state.
        </p>
        <p>
        The UA MAY move a session from <code>started</code> to <code>paused</code>, and from <code>paused</code> to <code>started</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
        The user agent is RECOMMENDED to pause the sampling of a profiling session if the browsing context is not in the foreground.
        </p>
        <p>
        The UA MAY move a session to <code>stopped</code> from any state.
        </p>
        <p>
        A <code>stopped</code> session MUST NOT move to the <code>started</code> or <code>paused</code> states.
        </p>
        <p>
        If the number of samples captured by a <code>started</code> session reaches the <a>sample buffer size limit</a>, the session MUST move to the <code>stopped</code> state and a new event of type <dfn>samplebufferfull</dfn> MUST be sent to the event handler associated with the session's associated <a>Profiler</a>.
        </p>

      <h2>Sampling Algorithm</h2>
      <p class="ednote">
      This section is non-normative for now, the specifics currently being driven by results from a prototype implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
      We define the <dfn>sampling algorithm</dfn> as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>env</var> be the script execution environment of the profiling session.</li>
        <li>Let <var>stack</var> be the stack of <dfn data-cite="!ECMA-262#sec-execution-contexts">execution contexts</dfn> associated with <var>env</var>.</li>
        <li>
          For each execution context <var>ec</var> on <var>stack</var>:
          <ol>
            <li>Let <var>ecs</var> be the script associated with <var>ec</var>.</li>
            <li>If the realm associated with <var>ecs</var> is not equal to the realm of the global object associated with the profiling session, skip.</li>
            <li>If the origin of the script associated with <var>ecs</var> is not equal to the origin of the browsing context, and its associated script tag (if present) does not pass a CORS check, skip.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, include the stack frame.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Record a new sample with all stack frames recorded in the algorithm, associated with the current timestamp relative to the browsing context's time origin.</li>
      </ol>
      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Note on script origins</h2>
        <p>
        A origin of an execution context's script (pending formalization) can be mapped into the following cases in lieu of a formal algorithm:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For a classic inline script, the origin is the document containing the script. <em>This holds irrespective of whether the script was injected by a cross-origin script.</em></li>
          <li>For a classic external script fetched over HTTP, the origin is derived from its URL.</li>
          <li>For a module script, the origin is derived from its URL.</li>
          <li>For <code>data:</code> and <code>javascript:</code> URLs, the origin is the origin of the document containing the script tag.</li>
          <li>For an <code>eval</code>'d script, the origin is the origin of the origin of the source of the containing script. Recurse on this definition.</li>

      <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
      <p>
      The primary concern with profiling JavaScript running on an event loop
      shared by multiple browsing contexts is ensuring that stack frames from
      cross-origin browsing contexts are not leaked. The spec aims to avoid the
      leakage of such frames by utilizing a ECMA-262 realm-based filtering
      approach, allowing isolation of frames in profiling sessions to a single
      realm / frame to comply with the same-origin policy.
      </p>
      <p>
      Another concern is the leaking of function names from foreign-origin
      scripts, which wouldn't normally be accessible without the resource
      participating in CORS. The spec aims to mitigate this by only including
      such foreign-origin functions if the resource that contains them passes a
      CORS check. For classic scripts, this means that functions are only
      included in traces if the <code>crossorigin</code> bit traditionally used
      for uncensoring <code>Error.stack</code> contents is present in the
      associated script tag.
      </p>
      <p>
      As with any API that exposes accurate timing information, timing
      side-channel attacks are a risk. We are not aware of any new timing
      attacks enabled by this spec, but further analysis is necessary.
